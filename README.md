# LightPlotter
Allow for the placement of arbitrary lighting positions and fixtures on an important image, and calculate their beam and field throws based on an arbitrarily designated focal point. 

This is designed to immitate some of the functionality of VectorWorks Spotlight, although LightPlotter will not support drafting natively within the application. LightPlotter will eventually contain a library of common lighting fixtures with predefined photometric data, and for the user to save their own fixture library using a template fixture. LightPlotter will support common scale factors for rendering lighting positions and fixtures, including 1' = 1' scale.
